Notes on graphql

1 - tried django-graphql
    schema.py describes the schema - references the view and serializer classes
    Easy to ask questions {
  users {
    id
    username
    preferences {
      id
      application
      value
    }
  }
}

Though I somehow seem to have broken it

fired up docker version of neo4j and loaded the csv files into it:
sudo docker run     --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687     --volume=$HOME/neo4j/data:/data     --volume=$HOME/neo4j/logs:/logs --privileged=true     neo4j &

note: without --prvileged=true can not read and write the data and log directories

.....
Questions:
   how much of the graphiness should be in the graphql schema and how much should be in a graph database
   Can I add schema that has nothing to do with django to the schema and use that server (can not see why not)
   What should the URLs for graph queries look like (as opposed to the graphql queries which are inherently relational)

   expressing the relations in the schema trades the rest explosion of endpoints for a graphql explosion of schema code
