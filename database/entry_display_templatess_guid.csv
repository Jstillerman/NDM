There is some irony in the fact that it was probably intentional disruptions produced by Bob's gas jet that finally did the loop in, but it has been intermittently failing with increasing regularity for a couple of weeks.Fortunately, the F15 loop signal can be replaced by combinations of other loops on the outer wall, so an in-principle exact software workaround for the loss of this signal is available. Unfortunately, the previously coded implementation of this workaround turned out to be buggy, so we lost six hours on Thursday instead of just one or two.New predictor algorithms have now been prepared and successfully tested off-line, and will be used during plasma operation today. When loading shots or importing segments from shots earlier than 1090925001 you will get the Configuration ID Warning message, telling you to ""recalculate all magnetic predictors"". As usual, this means you will need to1) go into the Edit Wire screens for each of the magnetics predictors (BR_0,BZ_0,RCUR,ZCUR,RXL,ZXL,RXU,ZXU,SSEP,STRKPSI, ClEARIN) that appear in any loaded or imported segment, noting any values in the OFFSET column2) hit the CALL button for all rows that have an algorithm name other than CLEAR or CUSTOM3) Replace any non-zero entries in the OFFSET column which get reset to zero by the CALL.4) APPLY (or OK) the screen,5) OK the Factor screen when it pops up, and also any P_INFO warnings that appear.You do not need to, and generally should not, re-Call predictors for the coil currents, NL04, B21_PROJ, EF2_BY_EF4, or IP as part of this fix.You should do the preceding operations #1-5 for all segments if you have re-loaded an old shot, but if you do not want to take the time to do this for unused segments, then please hit the ""Zero"" button (bottom of the segment column, first button int the last row above the ""DPCS Loadable Procedures"" box, so that non-fixed predictors aren't left around for the next operator.Since this fix involves removing a signal from the predictors, the automatic check_predictor routine will flag any wires in active segments which still contain the bad signal by popping up a warning widget during LOAD. If this happens, you need to acknowledge the pop-up, noting which wire(s) are affected, and when the load completes go back and fix the problem.

Here are the updated notes for how physics operators should deal with the reversed field. These also appear in the logbook, under the PHYSICS_OPERATOR topic, entered on 17-AUG-2012.Physop notes for reverse field operation:On invoking PCS for the first run (or doing a LOAD_FROM or IMPORT_SEG fromany shot before 1120817000)PCS should bring up the configuration warning screens. Read what they sayand note all changes since the date of the shot you are loading. You canreview this information by pushing the ""Show HYBRID Config"" button at thebottom of the PCS main screen.If you are starting from a normal field shot, you will need to:1) modify the sign of the PF and TF currents and voltages.2) recalculate the error field compensation algorithm (B21_PROJ)3)  point the DPCS_FIZZLE procedure at the reversed field shot 10605170074) If the shot comes from before 12/05/2011, then you need to recalculate   the magnetics predictorsIf you are actually starting from an old reversed field shot from 2011 or earlier, then the currents and voltages should be ok, and probably theB21_PROJ predictor and the dpcs_fizzle setting will be as well, thoughit wouldn't hurt to check.You will need to recalculate the magnetics predictors. sincea number of flux loops and bp coils have broken and/or been replaced sincethe last reversed field run.Detailed instructions for converting a normal field shot are:Step 1:For each segment (it is best to deal with all of them, even the unusedones, to avoid future accidents), bring up the ALL_P and ALL_V screensand use the ""FLIP"" menu item (on the pop-up menu under the right mousebutton) to invert the following waveforms:      ALL_Ps (seg1): IC_OH1,IC_OH2U,IC_EF1U,IC_EF1L,IC_EF2U,IC_EF2L,IC_EF4U,IP      note: all of the traces in the right-hand column      ALL_Vs (seg1): OH1_VOLT,CHOPPER,OH2U_VOLT,OH2L_VOLT,EF1U_VOLT,EF1L_VOLT,      EF2U_VOLT,EF2L_VOLT,EF4_VOLT,EF3_VOLT,TF_CURRENT      note: everything except the pulse gas lines.      ALL_Ps (seg2-4) EF2_by_EF4,IC_EF4U,IP (and any other IC_* that may be there)      ALL_Vs (seg2-4) OH1_VOLT,CHOPPER,OH2U_VOLT,OH2L_VOLT,EF1U_VOLT,EF1L_VOLT,      EF2U_VOLT,EF2L_VOLT,EF4_VOLT,EF3_VOLT,TF_CURRENT      note: everything but the pulse gas lines and ACOIL_CURStep 2:If using the B21_PROJ feedback for locked mode control it is necessaryto recalculate the predictor on this wire. Note that the correct acoilconfiguration for reverse field is (-Dtop +Dbot +Jtop -Jbot), the reverseof the normal field direction. This must be properly entered by theEngOp on his screen, and should be specified on the Physop run plan.To recalculate the B21_PROJ predictor, click on the button to bring up theEDIT_WIRE screen. If the EO has already entered the Acoil configuration onhis control screen then it should be sufficient to click the CALL buttonon the middle row, for the algorithm ""nonaxi_smw"". However, to be sure thatthe correct configuration is used, type the following lineACOIL_CONFIG=""-DTOP +DBOT +JTOP -JBOT""into the Keyword Args field, and then click CALL. After the call completes, theAlg. Version field should read: 07-Aug-2009,total 2/1 non-axisymmetric field at phi=  18.67 degrees, Acoil=-DTOP+DBOT+JTOP-JBOTYou can then OK the EDIT_WIRE screen, Acknowledge the P_INFO warning, and OKthe Verify Factor screen.It would be a good idea to change the Segment Title to indicate thatthe programming is for reversed field.Step 3:The dpcs_fizzle sequence also needs to be changed for reverse field.Click on the ASYNC_PROS button in the next to the last row on the mainPCS screen, and click on the ""dpcs_fizzle"" menu item. This will bringup an EDIT_Procedure popup form. Change the value in the field labeledSOURCE_SHOT to 1060517007. Then OK the EDIT_Procedure screen.**** IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO GET THIS RIGHT! ****If you've started from a recent shot and used IMPORT_SEGMENT to recoverolder programming, which I recommend, then the dpcs_xjump and dpcs_piezo_chopperprocedures should be present. It's worthwhile to check these. The dpcs_xjumpthreshold (under Paramters) should be set to 1.0e15. The dpcs_piezo_chopperOUTPUTS field should be a string array containing the names of pulsed gas valves, typically [""pulse_gas1"",""pulse_gas3"",""H-bot     ""].The remaining question is what to do about the RCUR offset and BR_0 offsetin segment 1 for the startup. I think the sign on RCUR offset should bereversed, say from 3000 to -3000, but we'll have to see what works. Recentstartups have used a BR_0 offset of 0.001, and probably that should be changedto -.001. Hopefully we will refine these settings on Monday.

These startup-current rise combinations, which were originally developed by Ian and Chuck Kessel for ITER studies, have a number of advantages, including better control of the early Mo influx by reducing the time on the inner wall, easier access to low current flattops without overshooting, and, in principle, better control of the currentramp. However, care must be taken when using these shots as references because they have certain requirements that are not consistent with the majority of past C-Mod shots.First, it is important that the startup (segment 1) and the second (active) segment go together. Of course, the engineering cpntrol parameters must also be taken from one of these shots.  This is because the startup includes an early (.04sec) crowbar time (normally this happens in the second segment, after 0.1sec) and begins early control of the current, which only gets to about 350kA by segment switch. Note also that the segment switch is supposed to happen at 0.08 sec instead of 0.10 sec, another reason that these segnents have to go together. It is a bad idea to try to graft a standard second segment onto the early crowbar startup, because most standard flattop segments expect the current to be over 500kA at the switch time,resulting in a major thrash as the current feedback comes on. They also sometimes have feedforward voltages  that anticipate crowbars on the OH's at .12sec and on the EF1's at 0.2sec, which is not the case for these shots. It's also a bad idea to try to use the active segment from these shots with a standard startup in segment 1, because that will also result in a thrash, in the opposite direction.Second, if starting from 1140808030 (or 27,28, oe 29 from that day) and reducing the current from 1.1MA to something lower, the physop needs to be aware that this shot is at quite high elongation and is close to vertical instability. At lower current, the li will be higher and the danger of vertical instability, especially right after the early diversion, is increased. It will be helpful to reduce the elongation by decreasing clearin, especially early in the discharge, thus decreasing the gaps, which are quite large in that reference. An example where this has been done successfully for a 550kA shot is 1140815004.
